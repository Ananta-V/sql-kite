Great question! Let me walk you through the complete developer workflow:

1. Installation
This installs the sql-kite CLI globally.

2. Database Location
All SQL Kite data lives in:

On Windows: C:\Users\<you>\.sql-kite\runtime\<project>\

3. Development Workflow with Expo
Step 1: Create the database project
This starts a local API server (e.g., http://localhost:5480).

Step 2: Design your schema in Studio
Open the browser UI, create tables, run queries, test migrations.

Step 3: Expo app talks to SQL Kite via HTTP
During development, your Expo app connects to the SQL Kite API:

4. Architecture During Development
Key endpoints your Expo app can use:

POST /api/query — Execute SQL and get results
GET /api/tables — List all tables
GET /api/tables/:name — Get table schema
5. For Production (Expo)
SQL Kite is a development tool. For production, you have options:

Option A: Export schema + seed data
Then use expo-sqlite in your app:

Option B: Bundle the .sqlite file
Copy db.sqlite from ~/.sql-kite/runtime/my-app/ into your Expo app's assets, then load it with expo-sqlite.

Summary
Phase	Where DB Lives	How App Talks
Development	~/.sql-kite/runtime/<project>/db.sqlite	HTTP to localhost:5480
Production	Bundled in app or created on device	expo-sqlite native
SQL Kite gives you a safe sandbox to design, test, and iterate on your database during development — then you export/bundle for production.
