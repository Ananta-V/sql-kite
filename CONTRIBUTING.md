First of all — thank you for considering contributing to SQL-Kite ❤️

SQL-Kite is a developer-first open-source project focused on improving database workflows, developer productivity, and clarity when working with SQL systems. We welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels.

Whether you are fixing a typo, improving documentation, reporting a bug, or building a feature — your help matters.

## Ways You Can Contribute

You can help the project in many ways:

* Reporting bugs

* Fixing typos or clarity issues
* Writing tests
* Improving performance
* Submitting code changes
* Reviewing pull requests

You do not need to be an expert to contribute.

## Before You Start

Please check the following before working on something:

1. Search existing Issues to avoid duplicates
2. If your change is large, open an Issue first to discuss it
3. Follow the Code of Conduct

This prevents wasted effort and helps maintain direction.

---

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork

-------
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sql-kite.git
cd sql-kite
------

3. Create a new branch

------
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
------

Please do **not** work directly on the `main` branch.

---

## Branch Naming Convention

Use clear branch names:

* feature/add-parser
* fix/connection-error
* docs/update-readme
* refactor/query-engine

---

## Coding Guidelines

We value clean, readable, and maintainable code.

Please follow these rules:

* Write clear variable and function names
* Keep functions small and focused
* Add comments where logic is complex
* Do not commit unnecessary files
* Avoid large unrelated changes in one PR
* Follow the existing project structure

Consistency is more important than personal style preferences.

---

## Commit Message Style

Use simple, descriptive commit messages.

Good examples:


add schema validation
fix connection timeout issue
improve query parsing performance
update documentation for installation


Avoid messages like

fixed stuff
update
changes


---

## Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch
3. Clearly describe what your PR does
4. Link related Issues (if any)

Please include:

* What problem it solves
* What changes were made
* Any potential side effects

Small and focused pull requests are preferred.

---

## Code Review

Maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes.
This is normal in open-source and not criticism — it helps maintain quality.

Please:

* Be open to feedback
* Ask questions if unclear
* Update your branch when requested
